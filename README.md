  The business shows seasonality, U.S.A with peak sales contributing $274.15k revenue with 54.12k as total shippment of mobile phones.

  United Kingdom follows in second position with the total revenue($106.01k) with 21.34k mobile phones being shipped in the period of seven months. Germany and Canada having $133.82k revenue and 24.58k mobile phones being shipped between december 2024 and june 2025. Germany and Canada with a slight  difference of $3931.84 revenue. The difference between U.S.A and United Kingdom is $168136.15 revenue. With two consecutive months decline (-31.26% in April and -37.38% in May). This is no longer an isolated event but a confirmed downwards trend.

 ## Caveat and Assumptions
   The dataset provided is accurate and complete. This analysis is between december 2024 and june 2025 is not  a reliable predictor of future performance.
  There are some significant measurement errors in the data collection process.
  The data is based on a small sample size, so the results may not be statistically significant.
   
## Recommendations
 The most critical finding is the dramatic drop in shipments and revenue from April to June 2025.
 
 Immediate Investigation, Form a task force to diagnose the root cause.
 
**Key questions to answer;**

**Competitive Action**: Did a competitor launch a superior or more affordable product?

**Supply Chain Disruption**: Was there a production  component shortage?

**Marketing/Seasonality**: Was there a significant reduction in marketing spend or an unexpected seasonal dip?

**Economic Factors**: Are there broader economic issues affecting consumer spending in your key markets?

**Short-Term Tactic: Launch a targeted promotional campaign in the U.S.A and Canada for June to clear inventory and stimulate demand.**

 Enhance customer engagement, focus on increasing sales in the lower average contribution like United Kingdom, Germany and Canada. By targeting high income demographics and 
 improving product offerings.
 Strengthen market presence, leverage successful strategies from high performancing regions like U.S.A and U.K to boost sales in underperforming regions(Germanyand Canada) through tailored marketing  plus promotion. This will help the market team as well as Logistics department.

Optimize return management, implement more strengthen quality control and return policies to mitigate losses over the shippment process, ehance customer's statisfaction across all regions.

                          





# Data Cleaning Project By Using SQL
...


#### 1. Remove Duplicates From Dataset.
#### 2. Standardizing Of Data.
#### 3. Handling Null Valuea And Blank Values.
#### 4. Remove Columns And Row Basing On Analysis.


   ```SQL

      -- Create Schema
 CREATE SCHEMA projectchurn;

 USE projectchurn;

    -- Back Up raw Data-----
CREATE TABLE customer_details_backup
LIKE customer_details;

INSERT INTO customer_details_backup
SELECT * FROM customer_details;

 SELECT * FROM customer_details_backup;

CREATE TABLE order_details_backup
LIKE order_detials;

 INSERT INTO order_details_backup
 SELECT * FROM order_detials;

 SELECT * FROM order_details_backup;

      -- COMMIT;
```

       


## 1. WHY Remove Duplicates?
#### ❌ Problem:
Duplicate records skew analysis  during counts, averages, and totals become inflated.

#### ✅ Reasons:
Accurate counts: Duplicates make you think you have more customers and sales, than you actually do.

Fair representation: Each entity like customer and transaction should be counted once.

Prevents double counting in aggregations: SUM, AVG, COUNT all become wrong.

Machine learning issues: Models may overfit to repeated rows or give them undue weight.

```SQL
     -- check the duplicates with the table ----
    
SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY
          customer_id,signup_date,
          order_id, order_date,
          dish_name,
          restaurant_name,
          payment_method,
          last_order_date    ) AS row_num
FROM order_detials;
 
 WITH duplicated_cte AS
      ( 
 SELECT *, 
          ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY
          customer_id,
          signup_date,
          order_id,
          order_date,
          dish_name,
          restaurant_name,
          payment_method,
          last_order_date    ) AS row_num
 FROM order_detials)
                     SELECT * FROM duplicated_cte
                     WHERE row_num > 1;

      -- created new table with row_num column , the table is called order_details
 
      --  Remove the Duplicate Records---
DELETE FROM order_details
WHERE row_num > 1;


```

## 2. WHY Standardize Data?
### ❌ Problem:
Inconsistent formats cause mismatches, misgrouping and calculation errors.

### ✅ Reasons for text standardization:
"NY" vs "New York" vs "ny"  treated as different categories = broken grouping.

"john" vs "John" vs "JOHN"  case sensitivity breaks lookups and joins.

" 123 Main St" vs "123 Main St"  trailing spaces cause mismatches.

### ✅ Reasons for date standardization:
"12/31/2023" vs "2023-12-31" vs "31-Dec-23"  sorting fails, calculations wrong.

Age calculations, time between dates, seasonality analysis all require proper date format.

### ✅ Reasons for numeric standardization:
"$1,234" vs "1234" → text vs number = can't sum or average.

"5kg" vs "5"  units attached = treated as text.

"00123" vs "123"  leading zeros matter for IDs but not for math.

### ✅ Reasons for categorical standardization:
Consistent groupings  accurate segmentation and reporting.

Machine learning expects consistent label encoding.

```SQL

       -- Standardizing Data Format ---

SELECT * FROM customer_details;
UPDATE customer_details SET city = UPPER(city);
UPDATE customer_details SET city = TRIM(city);
 
SELECT * FROM order_details;

UPDATE order_details
SET signup_date = STR_TO_DATE(signup_date, '%m/%d/%Y');
UPDATE order_details SET order_date = STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%m/%d/%Y');
UPDATE order_details SET last_order_date = STR_TO_DATE(last_order_date, '%m/%d/%Y');
UPDATE order_details SET rating_date = STR_TO_DATE(rating_date, '%m/%d/%Y');
 
 
      -- RENAME THE COLUMN ---
     
ALTER TABLE cohort RENAME COLUMN order_date TO first_day_topurchase;
ALTER TABLE cohort RENAME COLUMN last_order_date TO last_day_topurchase;
 
     -- Changing Data Types into correct format ---
 
DESC customer_details;
ALTER TABLE customer_details MODIFY customer_id VARCHAR(5);
 
DESC order_details;

ALTER TABLE order_details MODIFY signup_date date;
ALTER TABLE order_details MODIFY order_date date; 
ALTER TABLE order_details MODIFY last_order_date date;
ALTER TABLE order_details MODIFY rating_date date;


```

 # 3. WHY Handle Null or Blank Values?
### ❌ Problem:
Nulls cause errors in calculations, broken joins and missing insights.

### ✅ Reasons:
Many functions break For example Excel formulas, SQL aggregations, Python math operations).

Visualizations hide data ; charts may show gaps or omit entire rows.

Statistical distortion; Ignoring nulls can bias results (e.g., only calculating average on non-null rows may overestimate).

Machine learning models can’t handle nulls , they require imputation or removal.

```sql


-- Null Values or Blank Values---

SELECT delivery_status FROM order_detials WHERE delivery_status =NULL;
DELETE FROM order_detials WHERE delivery_status =NULL;

SELECT restaurant_name FROM order_detials WHERE restaurant_names =NULL OR restaurant_name = '';
DELETE FROM order_detials WHERE restaurant_names =NULL OR restaurant_name = '';

UPDATE  order_detials SET churned = 'default_VALUE' WHERE churned IS NULL;


```
