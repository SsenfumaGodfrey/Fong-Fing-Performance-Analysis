 ## Caveat and Assumptions
   The dataset provided is accurate and complete. This analysis is between december 2024 and june 2025 is not  a reliable predictor of future performance.
  There are some significant measurement errors in the data collection process.
  The data is based on a small sample size, so the results may not be statistically significant.
   
## Recommendations
 The most critical finding is the dramatic drop in shipments and revenue from April to June 2025.
 
 Immediate Investigation, Form a task force to diagnose the root cause.
 
**Key questions to answer;**

**Competitive Action**: Did a competitor launch a superior or more affordable product?

**Supply Chain Disruption**: Was there a production  component shortage?

**Marketing/Seasonality**: Was there a significant reduction in marketing spend or an unexpected seasonal dip?

**Economic Factors**: Are there broader economic issues affecting consumer spending in your key markets?

**Short-Term Tactic: Launch a targeted promotional campaign in the U.S.A and Canada for June to clear inventory and stimulate demand.**

 Enhance customer engagement, focus on increasing sales in the lower average contribution like United Kingdom, Germany and Canada. By targeting high income demographics and 
 improving product offerings.
 Strengthen market presence, leverage successful strategies from high performancing regions like U.S.A and U.K to boost sales in underperforming regions(Germanyand Canada) through tailored marketing  plus promotion. This will help the market team as well as Logistics department.

Optimize return management, implement more strengthen quality control and return policies to mitigate losses over the shippment process, ehance customer's statisfaction across all regions.

                          





# Data Cleaning Project By Using SQL
...


#### Remove Duplicates From Dataset.
#### Standardizing Of Data.
#### Handling Null Valuea And Blank Values.
#### Remove Columns And Row Basing On Analysis.


     -- Create Schema -------
-- CREATE SCHEMA projectchurn;

-- USE projectchurn;

          -- Back Up raw Data
CREATE TABLE customer_details_backup
LIKE customer_details;

INSERT INTO customer_details_backup 
SELECT * FROM customer_details;

 SELECT * FROM customer_details_backup;

 CREATE TABLE order_details_backup
 LIKE order_detials;

 INSERT INTO order_details_backup 
 SELECT * FROM order_detials;

 SELECT * FROM order_details_backup;



## 1. WHY Remove Duplicates?
#### ❌ Problem:
Duplicate records skew analysis  during counts, averages, and totals become inflated.

#### ✅ Reasons:
Accurate counts: Duplicates make you think you have more customers and sales, than you actually do.

Fair representation: Each entity like customer and transaction should be counted once.

Prevents double counting in aggregations: SUM, AVG, COUNT all become wrong.

Machine learning issues: Models may overfit to repeated rows or give them undue weight.
