 ## Caveat and Assumptions
   We assume the provided dataset is accurate and complete. This analysis assumes that historical data between december 2024 and june 2025 is a reliable predictor of future performance.
   We assume there are no significant measurement errors in the data collection process.
   Caveat, The data is based on a small sample size, so the results may not be statistically significant.
   
 ## Recommendations
 The most critical finding is the dramatic drop in shipments and revenue from April to June 2025.
 
 Immediate Investigation, Form a task force to diagnose the root cause.
*Key questions to answer*
Competitive Action: Did a competitor launch a superior or more affordable product?
Supply Chain Disruption: Was there a production  component shortage?
Marketing/Seasonality: Was there a significant reduction in marketing spend or an unexpected seasonal dip?
Economic Factors: Are there broader economic issues affecting consumer spending in your key markets?

*Short-Term Tactic* Launch a targeted promotional campaign in the U.S.A and Canada for June to clear inventory and stimulate demand.
