## Project Background and Overview.
Fing Fong is  a global distributor and wholesaler. Founded in 2002 and  specializes in supplying Samsung mobile phones(cellphones). They are a key link between Samsung and the market. Selling to both B2B clients (70% of revenue like telecoms and retail chains) and B2C consumers (30%).
Started as a general phone distributor, strategically pivoted to focus on Samsung and successfully expanded into emerging global markets.
 They are respected, established company now facing key challenges like squeezed profits from intense competition, inefficient marketing and an inability to measure its true impact.
Complex inventory and supply chain management across different regions such as U.S.A, United Kingdom, Germany and Canada.

   Fing Fong has been successful but needs to become data-driven to overcome its challenges and grow. L'm partnering with the Head of Operations to extract insights and deliver recommendations to improve the company's performance across sales as well as helping the marketing team.
