## Project Background and Overview.
Fing Fong is a global distributor and wholesaler. Founded in 2002 and  specializes in supplying Samsung mobile phones(cellphones). They are among key link between Samsung and the market. Selling to both B2B clients (70% of revenue like telecoms and retail chains) and B2C consumers (30%).
Started as a general phone distributor, strategically pivoted to focus on Samsung and successfully expanded into emerging global markets.
 They are respected, established company now facing key challenges like squeezed profits from intense competition, inefficient marketing and an inability to measure its true impact.
